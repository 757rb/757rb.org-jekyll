# More About 757.RB & Norfolk, Virginia

As Route 66 was being by-passed by the new interstate highway system, Whiting Bros was forced to sell its once prosperous stations. Station #72 in Moriarty, NM, was bought by Sal and Inez Lucero in 1985. The station remains almost unchanged since Lucero, a lifetime Whiting employee, took over its operation.  It has become an iconic anchor on Route 66 for travelers from all over the world and has been a vital part of this small community for over 60 years.  The station received a matching grant earlier this year to restore its signs and the Luceros are very close to raising their portion of the funds.  The community is working to raise the last few thousand dollars to thank the Luceros for their contribution to the local economy over the years. Please join us by purchasing a 'We saved the signs!' t-shirt.  Everyone's participation is appreciated!
